If you've got local source code you want to add to a new remote new git repository without 'cloning' the remote first, do the following (I often do this - you create your remote empty repository in bitbucket/github, then push up your source)

1.    Create the remote repository, and get the URL such as git://github.com/youruser/somename.git

2.    If your local GIT repo is already set up, skips steps 2 and 3

3.    Locally, at the root directory of your source, git init

4.    Locally, add and commit what you want in your initial repo (for everything, 
    git add . 
    git commit -m 'initial commit comment')

5.    to attach your remote repo with the name 'origin' (like cloning would do)
    git remote add origin [URL From Step 1]
6.    to push up your master branch (change master to something else for a different branch):
    git push -p origin master
